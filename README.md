Workup is an app allowing restauranteurs to list their venues for use as co-working spaces by freelance workers during the daytime. Owners can choose which services they would like to offer, set the price and wait for workers to select their space to attend. Workers can see who else is attending the 'workup' and their job titles, thereby adding a professional networking aspect to the service.

Owner:

 - Owners are able to create an account (including their ABN and contact details)
 - Once they are logged in, owners can create a new 'Space' and complete a form stating which services they provide (e.g. food, meeting room, wifi). They can also upload multiple photos of their venue.
 - Owners' listings are automatically generated with a calendar and a map so that workers can begin booking.
 - Owners receive an email when somebody has made a booking.
 
Worker:
 
 - Workers are able to create an account (including their job title and profile photo).
 - They may then see which restaurants have bookings for the following day on the home page, search for restaurants according to location, or browse all restaurants.
 - In order to make a booking they can choose their date from the calendar, and will be redirected to the booking and payment forms (bookings are done by the day with a set daily price for each restaurant).
 - Workers then receive a confirmation email to let them know their booking has been successful.

Pending features:

- Worker profiles.
- Ability to search for restaurants by day (as well as location).
- Owners' capacity to set up membership or package deals for workers.
- Review and rating system.
- Admin dashboard.
- 360 photo compatibility for restaurant images.
